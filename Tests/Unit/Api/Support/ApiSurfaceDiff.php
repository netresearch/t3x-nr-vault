/**
 * Classifies the difference between two rendered API surfaces.
 *
 * A snapshot assertion that only reports "different" makes a new value
 * object look exactly like a deleted method, so every diff gets read with
 * the same shrug. This splits the difference into three buckets and answers
 * the only question the author actually has: may I regenerate the file, or
 * do I have to decide something?
 *
 * - **added** — a class, method, property, constant or enum case that was
 *   not there before. Additive; existing callers keep compiling.
 * - **removed** — gone. Every caller that used it breaks.
 * - **changed** — same member, different signature. Includes a widened
 *   constructor, which a plain line diff would report as one unrelated
 *   removal plus one unrelated addition.
 *
 * Members are matched by NAME, not by rendered line, so a signature change
 * lands in `changed` instead of showing up as an unrelated removal plus an
 * unrelated addition.
 *
 * Ported from nr-llm's `Tests/Unit/Api/Support/ApiSurfaceDiff.php`
 * (issue #306); only the "what to do" guidance differs, because the two
 * repositories keep their deprecation rules in different places.
